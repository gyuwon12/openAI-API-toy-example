## Introduction

The AI Service Implementation project showcases the integration of OpenAI API, FastAPI, and Streamlit to build and deploy various AI-powered services. By leveraging the capabilities of these frameworks and tools, we demonstrate how to create functional and interactive applications that utilize the power of artificial intelligence.

## Tutorials

Before diving into the project, it is recommended to go through the following tutorials to get familiar with the usage of the APIs:

1. openai_tutorial: This tutorial provides a basic understanding of using the OpenAI API and demonstrates how to integrate it into your applications.
2. fastapi_tutorial: The fastapi_tutorial covers the essentials of using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It explains the key concepts and guides you through setting up a basic FastAPI project.
3. streamlit_tutorial: The streamlit_tutorial focuses on Streamlit, an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. It provides hands-on examples to help you grasp the fundamentals of Streamlit.

## Services

This project includes the following services:

1. Translation: A service that utilizes the OpenAI API to perform text translation between different languages.
2. Ad Copy Generation: This service leverages the power of OpenAI to generate compelling ad copy for marketing purposes.
3. Document Summarization: The Document Summarization service uses OpenAI API to generate concise summaries of longer texts or documents.
4. Chatbot: An interactive chatbot service that utilizes OpenAI API to provide responses to user queries.
5. Voice-enabled Chatbot: This service builds upon the chatbot functionality by integrating voice recognition capabilities, allowing users to interact with the chatbot using spoken language.
6. Visual ChatGPT: A visually enhanced chatbot service that incorporates image recognition and generation capabilities, creating an interactive and engaging conversational experience.
